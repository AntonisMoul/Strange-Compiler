# Strange Compiler
This project is about a compiler for programming language **Strange**. Strange is a very simple language with finite programming capabilities but suitable for educational purposes.

This project contains 
+ Strange compiler implemented in C programming language
+ Strange's grammar
+ Example input code on Strange and the output code produced by Strange Compiler
+ A report in Greek with a more specific definitions about some functions and data structures
The Strange compiler developed during the undergraduate course **Compilers** of [Dept. Computer Science & Engineering, UoI](http://cse.uoi.gr/en/)
